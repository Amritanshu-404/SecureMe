# SecureMe – Platform to Secure Your Daily Life

A lightweight, offline-first personal security platform built with **Python (Flask)**.  
SecureMe offers **Folder Locking**, an **Encrypted Password Vault**, and **Secure Private Notes** — all stored locally with strong cryptographic protection.

---

## 🚀 Overview
SecureMe is built to help users secure sensitive data directly on their local machine—no cloud services, no external storage, and no data transmission.  
It integrates three major modules:

- 🔐 **Folder Locker**
- 🔑 **Password Vault**
- 📝 **Secure Notes**
- 🔏 **Master Passkey Authentication**

---

## 🎯 Core Features

### 🔐 Folder Lock Module
Secure any folder on your device using access restrictions.  
Uses system-level permission control with log tracking for each lock/unlock action.

### 🔑 Password Vault
A fully encrypted password manager powered by **AES/Fernet encryption**.  
Features include:

- Add, edit, delete password entries  
- Category-based sorting (Social, Finance, Work, etc.)  
- Local encrypted Excel storage  
- Automatic metadata logging

### 📝 Secure Notes
Create and store encrypted notes. Each note:

- Is saved as a `.docx` file  
- Is encrypted with a **unique random 6-character key**  
- Is logged with encryption metadata  
- Can be unlocked and edited in the app

### 🔏 Master Passkey
A secure login system based on:

- PBKDF2 hashing  
- SHA-256  
- Random salt  
- 200,000 iterations  

This master passkey is required to access any part of the system.

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

SecureMe uses industry-standard security techniques:

- AES/Fernet encryption for sensitive data  
- PBKDF2 for passkey hashing  
- Local storage of metadata (no cloud usage)  
- Unique per-note encryption keys  
- Completely offline, ensuring full privacy
